**Install Pandoc i Remote local for man page**

command: sudo apt install pandoc

**Create a man page**
create a new file in the folder , where python file is. name should be always python filesname.1.md fx binarysixcolumn.1.md


**Adding the NAME, SYNOPSIS and DESCRIPTION sections**

Format:  Name, Synopsis, Description
 Then save it. You have to run the following command for execution:

 commands ---> pandoc binarysixcolumn.1.md -s -t man -o binarysixcolumn.1

**Service for the Script**

Now we're going to define the service to run this script:

cd /lib/systemd/system/
sudo nano hello.service

The service definition must be on the /lib/systemd/system folder. Our service is going to be called "binar.service":

[Unit]
Description=Binary Clock
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python /home/pi/BinaryClock/binarysixcolumn.py
Restart=on-abort

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Here we are creating a very simple service that runs our hello_world script and if by any means is aborted is going to be restarted automatically. You can check more on service's options in the next wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd.

Now that we have our service we need to activate it:

**give right to service**
sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/binaryclock.service
chmod +x /home/pi/binarysixcolumn.py
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable binaryclock.service
sudo systemctl start binaryclock.service
